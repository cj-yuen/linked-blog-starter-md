- 2 schools of thought concerning: What is probability? 
	[[Frequentist View (Objectivist)]] vs [[Bayesian View (Subjectivist)]]
- difference between probability $\approx$ fuzzy concept & [[Probability Theory]] 

## Set Theory Review

- [[Empty Set]] 
- [[Subset]] 
- [[Set Universe]] 
- [[Complement]] 
- [[Union]] 
	$A \cup \emptyset = A$

	$A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset$ 
- [[Disjoint]] 
- [[DeMorgan's Laws]] 

## Experiments
