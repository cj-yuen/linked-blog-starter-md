$$P_{\text{naive}}(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} = \frac{\# \text{ of outcomes in }A}{\text{total }\#\text{ of outcomes in }S}$$
>assumes all outcomes are equally likely 
$$P_{\text{naive}}(A^c) = \frac{\# \text{ of outcomes in }S\text{ but not in }A}{\text{total }\#\text{ of outcomes in }S} = 1 - P_{\text{naive}}(A)$$
