>transform given system $\rightarrow$ to new system that is <u>easy</u> to solve

## Steps (none change set of sys. of equations)
1) change the order (interchanging positions of 2 of them)
2) multiply one of the equations by nonzero constant 
3) add to 1 of the equations a multiple of another equation

- keep track of equation coefficients in a [[Augmented Matrix]]
