## Instruction Formats:
- [[Register-Type (R-type)]] 
- [[Immediate-Type (I-type)]]
- [[Store-Type (S-type)]]


## [[Instruction Encodings]]
- instructions are stored in memory over lifetime of the program
- all instructions have 'same length' (32 bits)

## [[Registers]] 
>we ==don't use variables== 


## [[RISC-V Memory Operations]]
>as we are limited to 32 [[Registers]], we stored values in memory (Stack, Heap, $\dots$) 
>	all values in memory must be <u>put on register</u> before used in operations


## [[Program Counter (PC)]]
>special register for address of curr instruction executing
