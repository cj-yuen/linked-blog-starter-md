## Complex vs Reduced
| Complex                          | Reduced                                      |

| instructions can do ==>1== thing | instructions can ==only do 1 thing== @a time |

## Examples:
- x86
	began in 1978
	CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
	==backwards compatible== 
- Arm
	began in 1981 by Acorn Computers
	major player in ==smart-device space==
- [[RISC-V]] 
	developed in Berkeley in 2010 & made to actually <u>be used</u>
