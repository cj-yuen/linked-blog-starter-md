## Graphics Processing Unit
>specialized processor in computer dedicated to handling graphics (parallel floating point operations)
>modern [[GPU]]'s consist of thousands of cores
>optimized for parallel computing (SIMD paradigm)
>	single instruction, multiple data
>	each core executes the same program, but receives different data on which to execute the program
