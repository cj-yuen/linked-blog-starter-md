#proposition  

>let $G= (V,E)$ be a [[Connected]], [[Undirected]] graph. Let $S$ be any subset of nodes that is neither empty nor equal to all of $V$. Let $e = (u,v)$ be the minimum cost edge w/1 end in $S$ & the other in $V-S$. Then some [[Minimum Spanning Trees]] of $G$ contains $e$ (<u>always</u> in the case where all edge weights are distinct)
