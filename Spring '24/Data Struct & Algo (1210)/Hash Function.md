$$h(k)$$
>a ==good== [[Hash Function]] satisfies (approx.) the [[Simple Uniform Hashing Assumption (SUHA)]] (each key is equally likely to hash to any $m$ slot)
>	unfortunately we rarely know the probability distribution from which keys are drawn (keys might not be drawn independently)
>	try to create well performing hash functions by doing so in a way that we expect the function to be independent of any patterns than might exists in the data
