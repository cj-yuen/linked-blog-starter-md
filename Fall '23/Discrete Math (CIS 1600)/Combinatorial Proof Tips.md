- use the "easier" looking side to pose your counting question 
- be ==creative== 

See $\sum$ -> breaking up what you want to count into disjoint group 
See $*$ -> consider creating a counting procedure & applying [[Multiplication Rule (M.R.)]] to multiply terms 

## Warnings
- ==explicitly== pose a counting question 
- specify ==distinguishability== 
	- only people are assumed be distinguishable, nothing else
