How many permutations of a set w/$n$ distinct objects?
	Procedure w/$n$ steps with each step having 1 less ways to be performed than the previous giving us $n*(n-1) * \dots * 2 *1$
	by [[Multiplication Rule (M.R.)]] there are ==n! ways== 

ie. Given set $\{ a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h\}$ how many permutations of these letters contain the substring $abc$? 
	consider $abc$ as a single element, now we have a set w/6 elements -> 6! ways
