## [[Generalized Pigeonhole Principle]] 
considering $n$ pigeons to distribute into $k$, you will have at least 1 hole containing at least $\lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil$ pigeons 

## [[Pigeonhole Principle]] 
when proving that "distributing items into categories" in some way will result in a particular outcome

## Patterns to Look ðŸ‘€ For 
- final line of a question (Prove that $\dots$) -> good hint to use PHP
- "$\dots$ Prove that there must be at least 1 $X$ w/ at least 2 $Y$"
- "$\dots$ Prove that at least 2 $Y$ will have the same $X$"
- if question $\neq$ these patterns -> ==think outside the box==
