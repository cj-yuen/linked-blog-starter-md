>$P(n,r)$ or $r$-permutations = permutations of $r$ elements out of $n$ total elements 
>	ie. given $S = \{ a,b,c\}$, the $2$-permutations are: $ab$, $ba$, $ac$, $ca$, $bc$, $cb$  

$$P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$

ie. How many ways to pick a 1st prize, 2nd prize, and 3rd prize winner from 100 different contestants? 
	$P(100,3) = \frac{100!}{97!} = 100 * 99 * 98$
