- [[Set Equality]] A = B
- [[Cardinality]] |S|
- [[Subset]] $A \subseteq B$ 
	- the [[Empty Set]] is a subset of any set $S$ 
- [[Proper Subset]] $A \subset B$ 
- [[Power Set]] P(S) 

## Commonly Used Sets 
- set of ==natural #'s== 
$$\mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,3,\dots \}$$
- set of ==ints== 
$$\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots, -2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}$$
	set of ==positive ints ==
$$\mathbb{Z^+} = \{ 1, 2, 3, \dots \}$$
	set of ==negative ints== 
$$\mathbb{Z^-} = \{\dots, -3, -2, -1 \}$$
- set of ==rational #'s==
$$\mathbb{Q} = \{p/q \mid p \in \mathbb{Z}\text{, and }q\ne 0 \} $$
- set of ==real #'s ==
$$R$$
